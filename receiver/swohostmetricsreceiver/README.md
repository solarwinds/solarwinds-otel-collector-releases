SWO host metrics receiver generates metrics related to host. Receiver's purpose is to deliver functionality, which is not currently part of [opentelemetry-collector-contrib], or existing
implementation in contrib differs from our expectations.

## Receiver Configuration

Receiver supports collection interval configuration and generaly collection of scrapers.

```yaml
swohostmetrics:
  collection_interval: <duration> # default = 30s
  scrapers:
    <scraper1>:
    <scraper2>:
    ...
```
