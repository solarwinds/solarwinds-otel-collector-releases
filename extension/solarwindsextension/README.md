The SolarWinds Extension offers capabilities related to the SolarWinds Observability SaaS platform and is required for the [SolarWinds Exporter](../../exporter/solarwindsexporter) to function.

It provides these features:

- Endpoint configuration for the Solarwinds Exporters
- Heartbeat signal
  - It's a standard metric: `sw.otecol.uptime`
    - The value is a time from the start of the collector in seconds
  - This signal is necessary for SolarWinds Observability SaaS to detect the collector when installed and to determine if it's still alive.
  - It also contains some additional information as resource attributes for SolarWinds Observability SaaS:
    - Collector name: `sw.otelcol.collector.name`

## Getting Started

You just need to include the SolarWinds Extension in your extension definitions and provide the following configuration:

```yaml
extensions:
  solarwinds:
    token: "YOUR-INGESTION-TOKEN"
    data_center: "na-01"
    collector_name: "Collector Display Name"
    resource:
        custom_attribute_1: "some optional value 1"
        custom_attribute_2: "some optional value 2"
```
- `token` (mandatory) - You can generate your token in your SolarWinds Observability SaaS account under _Settings / API Tokens / Create API Token_. The type is "Ingestion". You can find the complete documentation [here](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/content/settings/api-tokens.htm).
- `data_center` (mandatory) - Data center is the region you picked during the sign-up process. You can easily see in URLs after logging in to SolarWinds Observability SaaS - it's either `na-01`, `na-02`, `ap-01` or `eu-01`. Please refer to the [documentation](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/observability/content/system_requirements/endpoints.htm#Find) for details.
- `collector_name` (mandatory) - The collector name passed in the heartbeat metric (as `sw.otelcol.collector.name` resource attribute) to identify the collector. Doesn't have to be unique.
- `resource` (optional) - You can specify additional attributes to be added to the `sw.otecol.uptime` metric. 
- `without_entity` (optional) - You can disable Collector entity creation in SolarWinds Observability by setting it to `true`. If not configured, entity creation is enabled by default.
## Development
- **Tests** can be executed with `make test`.
- After changes to `metadata.yaml` generated files need to be re-generated with `make generate`. The [mdatagen](http://go.opentelemetry.io/collector/cmd/mdatagen) tool has to be in the `PATH`.
