`utf8consistency` processor makes sure signals contain only UTF-8 compliant data. Sending UTF-8 non-compliant data results in discarding the whole data batch on server side, as it expects UTF-8 compliant data only.

Current implementation guards UTF-8 compliance of attribute values across all scopes. When UTF-8 non-compliant data is encountered, it is sanitized to UTF-8 encoding (resulting in potential '�' characters).

## General processor configuration

There is no specific configuration defined for the processor. It can be simply declared among other processors:

```yaml
processors:
  utf8consistency:
```
